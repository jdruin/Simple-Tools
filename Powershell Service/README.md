I always seem to need this little app but I write a copy and leave it with my employer.  This time  made a little version that I can tweak when I need it.
All it does is run a PowerShell script on an interval.  It also runs as a service so no need for someone to log in and run it.  This version does not check
if the script has completed or hung before launching again so only use it on quick or low issue scripts.
